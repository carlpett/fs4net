Simply put, fs4net is an encapsulation of the file system, targeted for the .NET platform. If your application needs to access the file system you might want to consider using fs4net.

The .NET framework leaves much to ask for when it comes to working with the file system. fs4net tries to amend these shortcomings. The goals of fs4net are the following:

   * Avoid primitive obsession by representing paths by Value Objects.
   * Support automatic testing by allowing you to have e.g. an in-memory file
     system in your test fixture and a real file system for your production
     code.
   * Enable the user to adhere to good programming practices by using
     exceptions for exceptional situations.
   * Provide good and specific exceptions when things go wrong.
